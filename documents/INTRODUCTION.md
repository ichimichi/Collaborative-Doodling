# INTRODUCTION #

Collaborative art can be defined simply as artwork that involves working as a team to create art, and each person contributes in some significant way to the artwork. 

The internet has provided a platform for people to express their views and ideas. Thus, we can use the internet to provide a way for artists or any person to share their ideas and art in real time.

The goal of Collaborative Doodling is to allow people to exchange ideas through their drawings without the need of being in the same location but give them the experience as though they are working together in a room, in one canvas.
