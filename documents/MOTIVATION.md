Collaborating drawings is generally bounded by geography. People have to be in the same place in order to collaborate. It may also be the case that people from differrent locations would want to discuss on their ideas and would want to illustrate them as though they are in the same meeting room.

Collaborative Doodling allows people to overcome the limitation of being in the same room to be able to share, collaborate and show their work. Thus, people from any part of the globe can work together to draw and make designs for any task. It also provides a platform for artists from different locations to come together to create art.
