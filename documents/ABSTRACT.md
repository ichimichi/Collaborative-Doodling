Collaborative Doodling connects people by giving them the ability to share their thoughts and ideas with others and see their contributions in real time, regardless of where they are geographically. This application is perfect for collaborating on designs in any professional area or just making masterpieces with your friends.

The user of this software application can either create or enter an existing room and collaborate with every person in that same room. They can use different colours to illustrate their design and save their work to view it later.
